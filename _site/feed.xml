        <title>Pink</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51r2Mg7-2WL.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Pink cover art&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lily loves all things pink—her boots, her bicycle, the food she eats—but she has no one to share them with. She tries to play with an assortment of animals but the snail is too slow, the chicken is too silly, and the goat eats her clothes. Then along comes a perfect friend, who is perfectly pink! The whimsical illustrations perfectly match the deceptively simple text, and children will love spotting Lily’s special friend on every spread. The result is a delightful exploration of misunderstanding, friendship, and obsession, without ever mentioning the word “pink”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three decades and more than one million copies later children still love hearing about the boy with the long name who fell down the well. Arlene Mosel and Blair Lent’s classic re-creation of an ancient Chinese folktale has hooked legions of children, teachers, and parents, who return, generation after generation, to learn about the danger of having such an honorable name as Tikki tikki tembo-no sa rembo-chari bari ruchi-pip peri pembo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The station wagon, the tow truck, the garbage truck and the bulldozer. Every manner of machinery that moves is riotously depicted in this classic favorite. As the pig family head to the beach for a picnic, they encounter every vehicle known, from the forklift to the locomotive, and many vehicles that are not as common, from the pumpkin car to the broom-o-cycle. Each detailed spread provides tremendous opportunity to make up stories and describe situations. Will Officer Flossy catch Dingo? Will Rollo Rabbit catch his runaway steamroller? And with literally hundreds of things to look at, youngsters will spend hours trying to find Goldbug on every page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which bird has caught the worm? Where is the queasy monkey? And can you spot the scaredy-cat? Never has a search-and-find game been so pleasing to the eye. Each spread features fun rhyming couplets, beautiful and complexly patterned artwork, and a hidden surprise.&lt;/p&gt;

title:  "Everybody Bonjours!"

description: "Shop a fancy France-y store. Eat a pretty petit four. Discover! Sightsee! Explore! On this fun and friendly tour, everybody says “Bonjour!” Whether at a soccer stadium (“players scoring”), a crêpe stand (“batter pouring”), or strolling the Champs d’Elysee (where folks “bonjour” in every store), a little girl and her family are welcomed everywhere with the signature French greeting. Jump into these pages and enjoy the trip! Through lilting words and lively images, <em>Everybody Bonjours</em> welcomes young reader-travelers to a Paris that isn’t just for artists, grown-ups, and dreamers—it’s for kids!"

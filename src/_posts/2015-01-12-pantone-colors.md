title:  "Pantone: Colors"

description: "This artful first colors book introduces children to 9 basic colors and 20 shades of each. Readers will immerse themselves in the concept that one color name actually refers to a variety of dark, light, and in-between tones. Young children will begin by simply naming the colors of the monochromatic images and will soon grow to select their favorite and least-favorite shades. <em>Pantone: Colors</em> is a visually pleasing way to expand the colors conversation and develop a childâ€™s sense of visual discrimination."

title:  "People"

description: "Mother and father, dancers and warriors, gardener and farmer, hypnotist and genie…All sorts of people appear in People, linked together in ways that begin to emerge page after page. Real, mythic, and imaginary types inhabit this extraordinary, gorgeously rendered world, referring to each other through form and function. Like Blexbolex’s earlier book Seasons, this is a conceptual book, where the connections between the images are both clear and subtle."

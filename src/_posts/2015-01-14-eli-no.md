title: "Eli No!"

description: "Eli is a sweet black dog with a knack for getting into huge messes. He makes his disastrous way through the house and the yard, at every turn disobeying his owners, who each time repeat with mounting exasperation, “Eli, no!” At the end of the day, there’s only one important question left to answer: Do his owners still love him? Of course, in this case the answer is “Eli, yes!” Eli and his antics are depicted in clean, graphic spreads with a fresh and modern palette. Readers will enjoy adding their voices to the call of “Eli, no!”"

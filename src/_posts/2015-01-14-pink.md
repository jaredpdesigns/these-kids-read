title:  "Pink"

description: "Lily loves all things pink—her boots, her bicycle, the food she eats—but she has no one to share them with. She tries to play with an assortment of animals but the snail is too slow, the chicken is too silly, and the goat eats her clothes. Then along comes a perfect friend, who is perfectly pink! The whimsical illustrations perfectly match the deceptively simple text, and children will love spotting Lily’s special friend on every spread. The result is a delightful exploration of misunderstanding, friendship, and obsession, without ever mentioning the word “pink”."

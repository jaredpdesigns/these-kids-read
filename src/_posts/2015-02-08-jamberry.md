title:  "Jamberry"

description: "Hatberry, Shoeberry, In my canoeberry, Under the bridge, And over the dam, Looking for berries Berries for jam. They’re off…a boy and an endearing, rhyme-spouting bear, who squires him through a fantastic world of berries. And their adventure comes to a razzamatazz finale under a starberry sky.
A young boy and a bear joyously romp through the land of berries where there are raspberry rabbits and a brassberry band with elephants skating on strawberry jam!"

description: "Children and parents alike will delight in this joyous declaration of toddler independence. This book celebrates the feats of growing out of babyhood and starting to embrace the world on your own terms. Whether itâ€™s being tall enough to reach a high shelf or brave enough to splash in the waves, Krensky and Gillingham address the small victories that come with growing just a little bit older. Energentic text and retro-fresh illustrations celebrate this important developmental stage with charm and relevance."

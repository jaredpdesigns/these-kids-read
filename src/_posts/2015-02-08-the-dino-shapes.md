title:  "Dino Shapes"

description: "This concept book from Caldecott Honoree Suse MacDonald presents a thrilling geometric puzzle: as readers turn the brightly colored pages, cut-out shapes come together to reveal a creature from long ago. Circles transform into eyes, diamonds transform into scales, and by the final, fold-out spread, the collage-style art has evolved into a friendly Brachiosaurus!"

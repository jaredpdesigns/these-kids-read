title:  "Doug Unplugs On the Farm"

description: "Doug and his parents are off to visit the grandbots. But when their journey is interrupted by some sheep in the road, Doug goes from downloading information about farm animals to actually interacting with them! Doug gets to learn by <em>doing</em>—he herds sheep, milks a cow, gathers eggs, and then uses good old-fashioned “horse sense” to get their car back on the road. <em>Doug Unplugs on the Farm</em> is a lively celebration of farm life and the value of hands-on learning that will encourage kids to go screen-free and explore the real world!"

title:  "Once Upon an Alphabet: Short Stories for All the Letters"

description: "If words make up the stories and letters make up the words, then stories are made up of letters. In this menagerie we have stories made of words, made FOR all the letters. The most inventive and irresistible book of the year spans a mere 26 letters (don’t they all!) and 112 pages. From an <strong>A</strong>stronaut who’s afraid of heights, to a <strong>B</strong>ridge that ends up burned between friends, to a <strong>C</strong>up stuck in a cupboard and longing for freedom, <em>Once Upon an Alphabet</em> is a creative tour de force from A through Z. Slyly funny in a way kids can’t resist, and gorgeously illustrated in a way readers of all ages will pour over, this series of interconnected stories and characters explores the alphabet in a way that will forever raise the bar."

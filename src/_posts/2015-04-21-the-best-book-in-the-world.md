title:  "The Best Book In the World"

description: "If you found the best book in the world, would you stop reading? Could you stop reading? If you had homework to do, or dinner to get through, could you put the book down? On a train to the zoo or on a flight to Kalamazoo, would that break the spell? If in a forest you walked, while scary monsters stalked…would that be enough? If you’d crossed a desert that baked or were swept off by a river that snaked, would you even take a break? If every animal in the land were to be led by a big band, in a grand parade in your honor made…would you put the book down?"

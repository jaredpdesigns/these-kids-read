title:  "Smile"

description: "Raina just wants to be a normal sixth grader. But one night after Girl Scouts she trips and falls, severely injuring her two front teeth. What follows is a long and frustrating journey with on-again, off-again braces, surgery, embarrassing headgear, and even a retainer with fake teeth attached. And on top of all that, thereâ€™s still more to deal with: a major earthquake, boy confusion, and friends who turn out to be not so friendly."

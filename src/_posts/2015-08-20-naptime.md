title:  "Naptime"

description: "All of the animals in the jungle are grumpy—no, they will not take a nap! But one little girl may know just what to do to make sure these creatures can get some much-needed shut-eye. The crocodile and hippo insist that naps are for babies, the ostrich hides its head in the sand, and the hyena simply laughs at the suggestion. But the cranky expressions on the animals’ faces give them away—these grouchy beasts are all in serious need of a nap! Fortunately for these sleepy creatures, a little girl appears who knows the secret to a good snooze: first close one eye, then close the other one. And, just like that, all of the animals are out like a light. It’s naptime in the jungle!"

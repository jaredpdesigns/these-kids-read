title:  "Tools"

description: "Who do you think of when you see a hammer and a saw? A carpenter! What about a shovel and a watering can? In Taro Miuraâ€™s deceptively simple book children will discover more than sixty different tools, both familiar and new. Even the youngest readers will find the striking images engaging, and older children will be fascinated by the chance to guess which profession uses each set of tools before they turn the page. A wonderful tour of a variety of jobs and the tools they use to fix, build, and create."

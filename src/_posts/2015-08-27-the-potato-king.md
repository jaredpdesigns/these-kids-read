title:  "The Potato King"

description: "Once upon a time there was a Prussian King, Frederick, also known as Fritz, who saw potential in the lowly potato—a newly introduced crop from South America—and decided to plant it for his people. However, it quickly became clear that his subjects didn’t like being told what to eat. Determined to see the potato thrive, Fritz cleverly used reverse psychology to pique his people’s curiosity and make the crop popular, and the potato has flourished ever since. Potato-stamp illustrations throughout are simple and effective, exhibiting Neimann’s trademark wit and playfulness."

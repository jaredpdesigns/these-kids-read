title:  "If Kids Ruled the World"

description: "This original, fun picture book delightfully describes, in hilarious detail, a small child’s idea of utopia. Every two-page spread offers something new about this fantasy life, including, If kids ruled the world, every day would be your birthday! Birthday cake would be good for you. Your doctor would say, ‘Don’t forget to eat your birthday cake so you’ll grow up strong and healthy!’ And, You could go to any kind of school you like…Circus School, Fairy School, Inventing School. Lots of kids would go to Recess School. The topics that bestselling, award-winning author Linda Bailey has chosen are pitch-perfect for young children, from bedtime and baths (none!) to pets and tree houses (lots!). And illustrator David Huyck’s detailed, brightly hued artwork is full of energy, joy and humor that gets right to the heart of a child’s view of the world."

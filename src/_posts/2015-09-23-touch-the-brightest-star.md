title:  "Touch the Brightest Star"

description: "What happens while you’re sleeping? With lush, beautiful watercolors and cut-paper collage, Christie Matheson reveals the magic of the nighttime sky, using the same kinds of toddler-perfect interactive elements as her acclaimed <em>Tap the Magic Tree</em>. Wave good-bye to the sun, gently press the firefly, make a wish on a star, rub the owls on their heads, and…shhhh. No two readings of this book will be the same. That along with the gentle, soothing rhythm, makes <em>Touch the Brightest Star</em> a bedtime winner—no matter how many times you and your child read it."

title:  "A Rule Is to Break: A Child’s Guide to Anarchy"

description: "Simply celebrating childhood: the joy, the wonder of discovery, the spontaneity, and strong emotions…Wild Child is free to do as she pleases. <em>A Rule Is to Break: A Child’s Guide to Anarchy</em> follows Wild Child as she learns about just being herself and how that translates into kid autonomy. It presents the ideas of challenging societal expectations and tradition and expressing yourself freely in kid-terms that are both funny and thought provoking—it even functions as a guidebook for adults to understand what it is to be a critically thinking, creative individual. Wild Child is <em>the</em> role model for disobedience that is sometimes civil."

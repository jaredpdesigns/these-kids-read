title:  "Count On the Subway"

description: "<em>1 MetroCard, Momma and me. Down 2 flights—to catch the 3. 4 turnstiles, singers 5. A rumble, a screech…the train arrives!</em> This bright, young counting book is a delightful trip through the New York City subway system. Hand in hand, child and mother see colorful subway signs and funny passengers, watch trains screeching by, and make new friends. With bold illustrations and a playful, rhyming text, this is not only a counting book, but also a tribute to New York and a sweet story of a child and parent navigating the city together."

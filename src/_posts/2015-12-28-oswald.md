title:  "Oswald"

description: "Moving to Big City is certainly an adventure for Oswald the Octopus. When he and his pet hot dog, Weenie, arrive at their new apartment, they realize they need some help moving Oswald’s treasured piano. It’s very heavy. But Oswald doesn’t know anyone in Big City. Who will help him? One by one, Oswald’s friendly neighbors offer to help. Soon Oswald and Weenie meet Henry the Penguin, Johnny Snowman, the Egg Twins, and many other charming characters. And before they know it they’ve made lots of new friends."

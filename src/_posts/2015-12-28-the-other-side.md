title:  "The Other Side"

description: "In graphically stunning illustrations that feature many clever twists in point of view, familiar scenes turn and turn again to show us the back, the front, the top, the bottom, the opposite, the other side of each perspective. Here’s a door. What’s on the other side? Here’s a shoreline. What’s on the other side? Here’s a curtain. What’s on the other side? The answers may surprise you."

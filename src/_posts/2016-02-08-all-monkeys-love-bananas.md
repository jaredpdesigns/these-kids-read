title:  "All Monkeys Love Bananas"

description: "<em>Young Lou McGrew lives in tree twenty-four,
And he doesn’t like bananas, not anymore.</em> This adorable and humorous picture book features a poor monkey who just can’t bear the sight of one more piece of the yellow fruit. With whimsical illustrations and sing-song, rhyming text, this tale is about two friends who discover that the grass isn’t always more delicious on the other side."

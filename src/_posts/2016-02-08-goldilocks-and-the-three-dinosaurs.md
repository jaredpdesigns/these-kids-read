title:  "Goldilocks and the Three Dinosaurs"

description: "Once upon a time, there were three hungry Dinosaurs: Papa Dinosaur, Mama Dinosaur…and a Dinosaur who happened to be visiting from Norway. One day—<em>for no particular reason</em>—they decided to tidy up their house, make the beds, and prepare pudding of varying temperatures. And then—<em>for no particular reason</em>—they decided to go…someplace else. They were definitely not setting a trap for some succulent, unsupervised little girl."

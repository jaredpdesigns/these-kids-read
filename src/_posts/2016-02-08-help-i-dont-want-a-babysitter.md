title:  "Help, I Don’t Want a Babysitter!"

description: "A reassuring and hilarious look at a child’s trepidation about meeting his first babysitter then realizing he adores her! When Ollie’s parents hire a babysitter, Ollie’s cuddle buddy Stubbs imagines the worst: what if the babysitter sprays them with stinky perfume…what if the babysitter only cooks yucky green vegetables? But when Ollie and Stubbs meet Ella…what happens next just might surprise you!"

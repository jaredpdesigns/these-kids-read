title:  "Little Bird’s Bad Word"

description: "Little Bird learned a new word! He loves it so much that he’s bursting to share it with all of his friends. BLARK! BLARK! BLARK! The only problem is, this isn’t a very nice word. Little Bird doesn’t realize it, but this word might even hurt someone’s feelings. With the help of Papa Bird, maybe Little Bird will learn another new word—one that will make things all better."

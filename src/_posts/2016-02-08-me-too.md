title:  "Me Too!"

description: "There are many reasons why Annie is best friends with Lillemor, who is from Sweden. They’re the same age…They like the same colors…They like doing the same things…They can both speak another language. Okay, so Annie made hers up, but she is pretty sure it still counts. Annie and Lillemor like each other so much they play together every day. But then Lilianne, a new girl from France, arrives. Annie can’t stand that Lillemor has become friends with Lilianne, and that Lilianne seems to have more things in common with Lillemor than Annie does—even their names, which both begin with “Lil”! Has Annie lost her best friend forever?"

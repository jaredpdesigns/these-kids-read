title:  "Zoom, Rocket, Zoom!"

description: "When night has come and the moon shines bright, reflecting back our sun’s great light―explore the stars and search the sky, and watch for satellites gliding by! Ride a rocket to the stars as astronauts go zooming, booming, flying, and guiding their way through the solar system. Watch as they make moon landings, explore a new terrain, repair a satellite, and more in this exciting early introduction to all things outer space!"

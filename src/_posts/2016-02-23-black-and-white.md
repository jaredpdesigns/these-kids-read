title:  "Black and White"

description: "In this unheralded civil rights allegory composed in the heat of the early 60s, two little dogs frolic and dream of adventures beyond their wildest imaginations, from jungles of the Congo with towering ebony elephants to the whitewashed, frigid arctic where the icy white polar bears roam."

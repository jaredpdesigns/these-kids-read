title:  "Loula and the Sister Recipe"

description: "Loula’s three brothers, the Rotten Pirate Triplets, don’t want to play with her. “Brothers” mutters Loula, “the worst invention in the world.” She decides what she really needs is a sister, one just like her. So naturally, she asks her parents to make one for her. Only, it’s not that easy. Her father explains, “Making a sister is…well, it’s like making a cake. You need the right ingredients.” To make a sister, they say, you need a papa and a mama, butterflies in the stomach, a full moon, a candlelit supper, kisses and hugs and chocolate. Well, that’s no problem. Loula can follow this recipe! And she sets out with her loyal sidekick, the chauffeur Gilbert, to do just that."

title:  "Snowman In Paradise"

description: "We all know what happens the night before Christmas, but have you heard the story of the day after Christmas? In this imaginative book, author/artist Michael Roberts takes the traditional poem and turns it on its headâ€¦with hilarious results. Featuring a frozen snowman with a sunny disposition, a magical bluebird and a tropical vacation, this stunning book will elicit smiles any time of the year, and at Christmastime will lightly remind readers that there is no place like home for the holidays. A truly unusual holiday book that is perfect for Christmas and beyond."

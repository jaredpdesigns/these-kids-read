title:  "The Pencil"

description: "Welcome back Banjo, the boy from <em>THE RUNAWAY DINNER!</em> Once a pencil draws him, there’s no telling what will come next—a dog, a cat, a chase (of course), and a paintbrush to color in an ever-expanding group of family and friends. But it’s not long before the complaints begin—“This hat looks silly!”, “My ears are too big!”—until the poor pencil has no choice but to draw…an eraser."

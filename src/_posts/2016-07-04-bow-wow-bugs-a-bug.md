title:  "Bow-Wow Bugs a Bug"

description: "Bow-Wow may look like your average terrier. The streets he walks may seem familiar. But just around the corner, things get a little unusual. With a spring in his step and his tail only occasionally between his legs, Bow-Wow faces down every foe—well, <em>almost</em> every foe—in his path. Step aside, mutts. There’s a new dog in town."

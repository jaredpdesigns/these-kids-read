title:  "Dear Garbage Man"

description: "It is Stan’s first day on the job as a garbage man. He is very happy. The first piece of trash he finds in a horseshoe made of flowers, with a ribbon that says “Best Luck to Emily.” It is much too pretty to throw away, so Stan hangs it on the front of his truck. All day long people admire the cheerful-looking garbage truck named Emily. And the horseshoe is just the first thing Stan saves from Emily’s chewer-upper. At day’s end, Emily is piled sky-high with trash—Stan the garbage man doesn’t seem to want to put anything in the garbage!"

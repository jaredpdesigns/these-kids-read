title:  "Duck In the Fridge"

description: "It’s time for bed, but that doesn’t mean it’s time for the same old boring bedtime story. This one starts with a boy who discovers a duck in his fridge. Soon there are more ducks, and the only thing they are interested in is having fun. So the boy gets some dogs to scare them away…but things don’t go quite the way he planned. More and more animals arrive, and soon there’s a party. Will the boy ever be able to get to sleep?"

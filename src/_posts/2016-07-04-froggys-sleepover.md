Now, he’s ready to <em>flop flop flop</em> off to Max’s house. But then Froggy decides it would be a good idea to go back to his own house. So off they go—<em>shloop</em>! Then Max gets a tummy ache and wants to go back to his own house. So off they go—<em>shloop</em>! Back and forth they go between the two houses. Froggy’s Sleepover is sure to dissolve any sleepover worries into giggles as Froggy and Max delight young readers with sleepover fun."

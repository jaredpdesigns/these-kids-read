title:  "Itty Bitty"

description: "Itty Bitty is a very, very tiny dog. But when he finds an enormous bone, he goes straight to work, gnawing out doors and windows and hollowing out the entire inside. When his work is done, however, his cavernous house still feels incomplete. Where can he find some itty-bitty things that will make this bone a home? Everyone from dollhouse lovers to grown-ups setting up a home of their own will fall for this comical tale of an optimistic canine who is small in stature but huge in charm."

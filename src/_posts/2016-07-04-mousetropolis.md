title:  "Mousetropolis"

description: "City Mouse leaves his noisy apartment for a vacation in the country only to find drab meals, unseen predators, unbearable heat and too much quiet! So City Mouse takes his country cousin to Mousetropolis, where a rodent can indulge in rich food and rub elbows with the elite. But just as the party is getting started, disaster strikes! A cat attacks, scaring the city sophisticates clear out of their fine attireâ€¦while Country Mouse runs without stopping until he reaches the familiar fields of home."

title:  "Pete the Cat: I Love My White Shoes"

description: "Pete the Cat goes walking down the street wearing his brand new white shoes. Along the way, his shoes change from white to red to blue to brown to WET as he steps in piles of strawberries, blueberries, and other big messes! But no matter what color his shoes are, Pete keeps movin’ and groovin’ and singing his song…because it’s all good. <em>Pete the Cat: I Love My White Shoes</em> asks the reader questions about the colors of different foods and objects."

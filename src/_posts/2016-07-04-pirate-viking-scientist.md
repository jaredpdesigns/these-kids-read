title:  "Pirate, Viking and Scientist"

description: "In this tale of a classic friendship conundrum, a determined little boy wonâ€™t rest until he proves his theory that you really <em>can</em> have more than one best friend! Pirate is friends with Scientist. Scientist is friends with Viking. Pirate and Viking are NOT friends. What will Scientist do? Use his brain, of course! Scientist forms a hypothesis, conducts an experiment, observes his results, and tests his subjects again and again until he discovers the perfect formula for friendship."

title:  "Sophie’s Fish"

description: "What naptime story would you read to a fish? When Sophie asks Jake to take care of her pet fish while she’s on vacation, he says sure - how hard can it be to babysit a fish? But the minute he agrees, Jake starts imagining every possible fish-related crisis. What does a fish eat for dinner? How do you give him a bath? What kind of stories does he like? Pitch-perfect humor and wonderfully detailed, quirky illustrations make this a refreshingly funny and imaginative picture book."

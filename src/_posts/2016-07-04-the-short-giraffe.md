title:  "The Short Giraffe"

description: "Geri is the shortest giraffe in the herd, which causes all kinds of problems when Boba the baboon tries to take a photo. Can Geri stretch up tall enough to be in the picture? Or are the other giraffes looking at things from the wrong perspective? A very sweet story for pre-schoolers about difference and acceptance."

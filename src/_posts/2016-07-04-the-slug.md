title:  "The Slug"

description: "One in a series of humorous books about disgusting creatures, <em>The Slug</em> is a look at the land slug. It covers such topics as the slug’s two pairs of tentacles, one pair for seeing, one pair for smelling (it can see you’re a kid and smell like broccoli), its breathing hole (on the side of its head!), and its pretty gross mucous covering (in order to find a partner, the slug can follow another slug’s mucous trail. True love!). Although silly and off-the-wall, <em>The Slug</em> contains real information that will tie in with curriculum."

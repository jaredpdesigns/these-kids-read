title:  "My Dog, Bob"

description: "Like all dogs, Bob likes breakfast, riding in the family car, and digging for bones. But unlike other dogs, Bob cooks breakfast for himself and his family, drives the family car and digs for dinosaur bones with a paleontologist. When the girl next door challenges Bob s owner to a contest to see whose dog is best, Bob doesn’t sit, fetch or speak on command. Bob loses. I’m sorry, Bob says as the girl and her dog march off in triumph. But to make up for his deficiencies, Bob makes pizza for the family."

title:  "Have a Look, Says Book"

description: "Soft kittens, wooly socks, soggy mittens, fleecy flocks—this pictorial celebration of things tactile explores how what we touch touches us. There’s a reason why toddlers put everything (or so it seems) into their mouths—it’s how they understand it…with grabby hands, open mouths, and…here…open book. In <em>Take a Look, Says Book<em> fleas seem to hop off one page, peas squish bean-bag flat on the next. The images seemingly come to life, just as so much comes to life within our imaginations through reading, and handling things with just the right touch."

title:  "I Can’t Wait"

description: "Don’t wait to read this picture book about three friends who are each waiting for something worthwhile—and practicing patience while they’re at it! William was waiting on his front porch. Annie was waiting in her backyard. And, in his house on the corner, Thomas was waiting, too. But what are they each waiting for? When will it arrive? These three stories of three eagerly waiting friends come together in the end, where everything—especially friends and family—is worth the wait."

title:  "Chuck and Woodchuck"

description: "When Caroline’s classmate Chuck brings Woodchuck to show-and-tell, Woodchuck is so funny that their teacher says he can come to school every day! Woodchuck is friendly to everyone, but he’s especially sweet to Caroline. He gives her Chuck’s hat when her ears get cold and Chuck’s cupcake when she drops hers. But when Caroline forgets her lines during the class play, it’s not Woodchuck who comes to the rescue. A perfect read-aloud for facilitating friendships, this charming story recognizes that sometimes, making a connection takes time—but is worth the wait."

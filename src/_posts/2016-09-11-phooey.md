title:  "Phooey!"

description: "When a restless red-headed boy proclaims: “Nothing ever happens around here!” (And who hasn’t heard that complaint at home?), he kicks a can and sets into motion a series of wonderfully hilarious slapstick events that happen behind him—and because of him. With elephants on parade, pirates around every corner, pies flying, and oranges on the loose, Rosenthal creates an adventure-filled world that is anything BUT boring!"

title:  "Whale"

description: "When a giant whale washes up on shore—on top of young Joe’s town, in fact—no one knows what to do! The Mayor declares that the town is ruined. The Whale laments that all he’s good for now is a large fish pie. The Fishmonger quickly agrees. But Joe is determined to set things right. With the help of Joe, some impressive teamwork, invaluable wisdom from the Owl and the Innumerable Stars, and a whole lot of…singing, order is restored. Even better, Joe and his neighbors make a new—and very large—friend."

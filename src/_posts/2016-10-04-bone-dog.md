title:  "Bone Dog"

description: "Gus doesn't feel like doing much after his dog Ella dies. He doesn't really even feel like dressing up for Halloween. But when Gus runs into a bunch of rowdy skeletons, it's Ella—his very own Bone dog—who comes to his aid, and together they put those skeletons in their place. A book about friendship, loss, and a delightfully spooky Halloween."

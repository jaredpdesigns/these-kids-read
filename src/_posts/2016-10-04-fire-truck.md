title:  "Fire Truck"

description: "Matt loves fire trucks, and one morning when he wakes up, he is a fire truck—right down to his hoses, hooks, and ladders! His wheels and sirens couldn’t be handier for performing many important duties around the house, especially rescuing teetering teddy bears or precariously placed pets."

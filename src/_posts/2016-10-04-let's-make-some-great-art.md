title:  "Letâ€™s Make Some Great Art"

description: "In this interactive coloring and activity book, Marion Deuchars takes the broad canvas of art and fills it with drawings and activities that engage with what art can be, how it can be made, what it can mean for you and what it has meant for people through the ages. Aimed at children aged eight and older, the emphasis is on fun and making the creation of art an integral part of the way you express yourself."

title:  "My Dad at the Zoo"

description: "<em>My Dad at the Zoo</em> is another tale of role reversal in which Dad reverts to the unsocialized, wild ways of childhood. Probably tired from all of his wearying antics around bedtime, here Dad heads off to the zoo with his son and goes completely zany."

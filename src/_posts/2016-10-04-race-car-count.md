title:  "Race Car Count"

description: "Race car 1 honks look at me! He zooms in front with the turn of a key. Race car 2 is close behind. The sound of vroom is on his mind. This simple, rhyming text is perfect for reinforcing counting with young children, and the vibrant, energetic illustrations make this a terrific package for the youngest vehicle enthusiasts."

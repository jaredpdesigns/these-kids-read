title:  "Mystery at the Club Sandwich"

description: "Lola Gale has lost her marbles. Literally. Nick Trunk, private investigator, has been hired to find them. He’s a very good detective, but this case is a tough nut to crack. The only clues are an ostrich feather and lots of peanut butter—delicious peanut butter. Will Nick be able to solve this sticky crime? Monochromatic illustrations give this hilarious whodunit the dramatic feel of an old black-and-white movie, while endearing animals characters, plentiful P.I. and peanut puns, and a suspenseful but-not-too-hard-to-follow mystery make this a crime story that’s hard to put down."

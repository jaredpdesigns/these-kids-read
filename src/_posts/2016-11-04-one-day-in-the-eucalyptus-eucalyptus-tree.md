title:  "One Day in the Eucalyptus, Eucalyptus Tree"

description: "A sneaky snake has no idea that the captives in his belly are planning their escape! In the spirit of <em>There Was an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly</em> by Simms Taback, the reader sees a cutaway of the snakeâ€™s belly and can even guess how the tale ends! Classic and contemporary, timeless and fresh, <em>One Day in the Eucalyptus, Eucalyptus Tree</em> has a syncopated and rhythmically delightful text perfect for reading aloud."

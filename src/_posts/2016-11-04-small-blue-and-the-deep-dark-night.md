title:  "Small Blue and the Deep Dark Night"

description: "When Small Blue wakes up in the middle of the night, she thinks of hungry things…and warty things…and hairy things! But are they really as scary as they seem? With the help and comfort of Big Brown, Small Blue slowly begins to imagine fun things in the dark instead of scary ones."

title:  "The Boy with Two Belly Buttons"

description: "Solomon never thinks it’s strange that he has two belly buttons—until he finds out that no one else does. Is having that extra belly button good or bad? Things look worse and worse until an unexpected encounter makes Solomon appreciate what it means to be a little bit different."

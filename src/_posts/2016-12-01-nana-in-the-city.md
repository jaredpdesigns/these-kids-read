title:  "Nana In the City"

description: "In this magical picture book, a young boy spends an overnight visit with his nana and is frightened to find that the city where she lives is filled with noise and crowds and scary things. But then Nana makes him a special cape to help him be brave, and soon the everyday sights, sounds, and smells of the city are not scaryâ€”but wonderful. The succinct text is paired with watercolor illustrations that capture all the vitality, energy, and beauty of the city."

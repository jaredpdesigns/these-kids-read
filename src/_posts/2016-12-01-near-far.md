title:  "Near, Far"

description: "In this playful, interactive introduction to ideas of perspective, you’re invited to guess the seven animals that hide in the book’s pages. It may sound easy but, at first, you can only see the animals right up close…and things look so different from up close and faraway! What looks like an elephant’s trunk might actually be a little birdie’s tail…and those two googly eyes? Well, when we zoom out, they don’t really look like eyes at all!"

title:  "One and All"

description: "One becomes many in this beautiful book about the relationship between the whole and its parts. Bold illustrations, hand-lettered text, and gatefolds serve to order and illustrate collections of people, things, animals, and plants, offering young readers a better sense of their own place in the world."

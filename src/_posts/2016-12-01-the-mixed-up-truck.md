title:  "The Mixed-Up Truck"

description: "It’s Cement Mixer’s first day on the job and he doesn’t want to make any mistakes. How can he help the other trucks on the construction site? By mixing some powdery white cement, of course! He mixes it up, adds a little water, and presto…a cake?! He must have mixed flour instead of cement. Not to worry, he’ll try again…and presto! Frosting?! He’ll keep trying until he gets it just right and it’s time for one more mixing: a bubble bath!"

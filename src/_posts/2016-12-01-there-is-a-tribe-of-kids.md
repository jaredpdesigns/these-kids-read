title:  "There Is a Tribe of Kids"

description: "When a young boy embarks on a journey aloneâ€¦he trails a colony of penguins, undulates in a smack of jellyfish, clasps hands with a constellation of stars,
naps for a night in a bed of clams, and follows a trail of shells, home to his tribe of friends."

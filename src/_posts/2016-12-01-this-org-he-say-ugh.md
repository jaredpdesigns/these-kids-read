title:  "This Orq. (He say “Ugh!”)"

description: "This companion to <em>This Orq. (He Cave Boy.)</em> pits Orq and Woma against a couple of stone-age bullies. Dorq is big, strong, and mean…and his pet, Caba, is even worse. But when Caba smashes a giant egg on Woma, Orq is so incensed he bangs two rocks together over and over, creating a spark. Like all good scientists, Orq recognizes an important discovery when he sees it. As he raises a flaming torch triumphantly, Dorq and Caba flee. Small Orq is the inventor of fire—and is a hero to his beloved Woma. An ode to the power of standing up for oneself, this book is the perfect antidote for any child who has ever felt small."

title:  "Tiger and Badger"

description: "Tiger and Badger are best friends. Of course, sometimes even very best friends can get into disagreements—over a toy, or a chair, or even sharing some orange slices. But no matter what, after a bit of pouting and with the help of some very silly faces, they always make up. Tiger and Badger is an exuberant read-aloud bursting with bright illustrations to hold the attention of very young readers just learning to make—and keep—friends."

title:  "An Otis Christmas"

description: "It’s Christmas eve on the farm where Otis and all of his friends live. The farmer has given Otis his first real Christmas present—a shiny new horn! A tree has been decorated, a big snowstorm is on its way, and all of the animals are excited. Best of all, one of the horses on the farm is about to give birth to a foal! Yet in the middle of the night the horse begins neighing in pain and when the farmer says, “We’d better get Doc Baker out here or we’ll lose ‘em both,” Otis knows the horse is in trouble. Snow has been falling hard for hours and the roads are unpassable. How will they got Doc? Otis to the rescue! He knows a shortcut through the woods and he arrives at the doc’s house flashing his headlights and revving his engine. When Doc fails to awake, Otis uses his new horn. Then, with Doc in tow, he races back to the farm just in time for a Christmas miracle…and the arrival of a new friend to play with."

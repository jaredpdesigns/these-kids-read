title:  "Best Frints In the Whole Universe"

description: "Yelfred and Omek have been best frints since they were little blobbies. They play and snack, and sometimes they even fight, all in a language similar to but slightly different from, English. When Omek decides to borrow Yelfredâ€™s new spaceship without asking (and then crashes it), it sparks the biggest fight yet. Can these two best frints make up and move on?"

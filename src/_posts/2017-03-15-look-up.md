title:  "Look Up!"

description: "A girl in a wheelchair looks down from her balcony and calls to passersby below: “Look up!” Dog walkers, a bike rider, a kite flier, and dozens of commuters walk by without taking any notice. Then a boy stops and looks up. He lies on the sidewalk so the girl can see him better. A woman joins him. Soon nine people and one dog are lying down and looking up. The girl looks up at the reader and smiles."

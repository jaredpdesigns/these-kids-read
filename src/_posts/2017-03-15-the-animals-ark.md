title:  "The Animals’ Ark"

description: "In this delightful picture book, award-winning author and illustrator Marianne Dubuc retells the biblical story of the ark voyage from the animals’ perspective. It begins with a light rain in the animal kingdom that turns heavier and steadier until all the land is flooded. The animals are huddled together atop a hill, the only dry spot left, when they spy a boat coming toward them. Rescue! The smiling captain, Mr. Noah, invites them to board, two by two. At first, the animals enjoy settling in and finding ways to amuse themselves—the sheep play leapfrog, the ladybugs play dominoes, a chameleon plays hide-and-seek. But as it continues to rain, and rain, and rain, things grow testy below deck. The animals are getting on one another’s nerves. And all of them are wondering, will the rain ever stop?"

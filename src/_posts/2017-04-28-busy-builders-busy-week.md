title:  "Busy Builders, Busy Week!"

description: "In this bright, bold picture book, a cast of animal characters are building a brand-new playground in a local park for their community! Each day of the week contains a different construction plan as the steam-rolling, digging, and planting gets underway. Tuesday! Mix day! Pipe and boards and bricks day. Stack, spin, pour it in. Give the fence a fix day. Wednesday! Load day! Take it on the road day. Hoist, haul, pull it all.
Something being towed day!"

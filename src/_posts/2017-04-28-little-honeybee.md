title:  "Little Honeybee"

description: "In a spring garden, the flowers are slowly blooming as the weather warms up. And as the flowers come out, so too do other forms of life, especially those all-important pollinatorsâ€”bees! This companion title to <em>Little Pear Tree</em> is a simple counting book with a difference: as readers count emerging spring flowers from one to ten, by peeking under petals and leaves, they will also discover the same number of bees humming and buzzing about."

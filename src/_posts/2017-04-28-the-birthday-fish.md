title:  "The Birthday Fish"

description: "Cynthia has always wanted a pony of her very own and is sure her parents will give her one for her birthday. But to her dismay, they give her a goldfish instead. Determined to get rid of it, she puts the fish in her doll stroller and sets off toward the lake. But during the walk, Cynthia discovers that this is a little fish with a big personalityâ€”could it be even better than having a pony?"

title:  "Esquivel! Space-Age Sound Artist"

description: "Juan Garcia Esquivel was born in Mexico and grew up to the sounds of mariachi bands. He loved music and became a musical explorer. Defying convention, he created music that made people laugh and planted images in their minds. Juan‘s space-age lounge music—popular in the fifties and sixties—has found a new generation of listeners."

title:  "Penguin‘s Hidden Talent"

description: "All of Penguin‘s friends are excited about the upcoming talent show, but Penguin can‘t seem to figure out what his talent is. He tries juggling appliances with Bear, doing magic tricks with Rabbit, and burping the alphabet with Fox, but he doesn‘t seem to be good at any of it. Stuck behind the scenes organizing, Penguin leaves the contest saddened, the only one who hasn‘t received a medal. His friends decide to throw him a party to make him feel better, but their festivities fizzle. That‘s when Penguin discovers he might have some special skills after all as he sets to work planning them all the best party ever."

title:  "The Happiest Book Ever"

description: "What could be happier than a book with a dancing cake, a candy parade, and a hug monster? A book with all those things (and more) plus YOU! Your happy, happy thoughts will make this book super happy happy! But something seems off. Could it be that frowny frog? Perhaps we could shake some sense into him, or slap a Post-it over his face. No? Well then, maybe its time for that frog to SCRAM! Hooray! He’s gone! Time for a happy dance! Wait, what’s wrong? Now NO ONE seems happy! Let’s see if we can’t do something to truly make this the happiest book ever."

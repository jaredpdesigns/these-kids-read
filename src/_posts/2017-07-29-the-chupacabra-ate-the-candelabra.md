title:  "The Chupacabra Ate the Candelabra"

description: "Like most goats, Jayna, Bumsie, and Pep’s greatest fear is being eaten for dinner by the legendary chupacabra—it’s common knowledge that goats are a chupacabra’s favorite food! One night, tired of living in fear, the impetuous goats whip out their trusty candelabra and head off to find the beast and scare it away before it can find them. Little do they know that candelabras are the chupacabra’s third-favorite food…and he isn’t about to stop there. This chupacabra has quite the appetite, and the goats are in for a big surprise!"

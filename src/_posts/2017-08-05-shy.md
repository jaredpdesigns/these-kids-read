title:  "Shy"

description: "Shy loves birds. He’d love to watch them fly and hear them sing, but he’s only ever read about them in books…until a real bird comes along. He’s dying to meet her, but there’s just one problem: Shy is, well, shy—so shy, in fact, that he’s afraid to leave the gutter of the book.  Can Shy overcome his fears and venture out onto the page?"

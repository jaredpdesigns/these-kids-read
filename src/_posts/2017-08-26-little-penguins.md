title:  "Little Penguins"

description: "Snowflakes? Many snowflakes. Winter is coming. So begins this ever-so-simple story. As the snow starts to fall, the excited penguins pull out scarves, mittens, heavy socks, and boots, and Mama helps them bundle up. But when itâ€™s time to go out, one timid penguin decides to stay home."

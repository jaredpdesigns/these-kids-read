title:  "Lost and Found: Adèle & Simon In China"

description: "When siblings Adèle and Simon visit their uncle in China, he buys them each gifts for their trip. Simon picks out a hat, a flute, a fan, and other small items, while his sister selects a camera to photograph their journey. As soon as they’re packed and ready, it’s time to set off with Uncle Sydney to explore! In a series of postcards home to their mother, Adèle describes each of the places they visit and the adventures they have…and, of course, what item Simon managed to lose at each stop along the way. On a silk farm in Shanghai, he loses his scarf. Along the Great Wall, his hat blows right off his head. By the end of the trip, Simon has misplaced all of his belongings! But when Adèle develops her photographs, she and her brother discover that they can see each of Simon’s lost items in the background of the pictures."
